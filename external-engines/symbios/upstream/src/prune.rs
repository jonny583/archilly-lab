//! Road pruning via Steiner tree construction.
//!
//! After lots are placed, many road segments may not serve any building.
//! [`prune_unused_roads`] identifies the minimal connected sub-network that
//! reaches every lot's frontage edge using Dijkstra shortest paths (preferring
//! major roads), then deactivates all edges outside that sub-network.
//! Disconnected components are handled independently so lots on isolated
//! islands still retain their access roads.
