//! Graph rationalization: straighten and smooth the road network.
//!
//! After the tracer produces a raw network of many small segments, this pass
//! rewrites the graph into cleaner geometry:
//!
//! 1. **Global Laplacian elevation smoothing** averages node heights across the
//!    entire graph, producing roads that bridge dips and cut through bumps.
//!    A maximum grade clamp limits slope between adjacent nodes.
//! 2. **Artery extraction** traces continuous paths *through* intersections by
//!    forward-vector alignment, allowing global straightening of avenues.
//! 3. **Ramer-Douglas-Peucker** decimation removes unnecessary intermediate
//!    points, straightening nearly-collinear runs.
//! 4. **Fillet corners** replaces sharp bends with smooth quadratic Bézier arcs,
//!    giving the network a civil-engineered look.
//!
//! The result is a graph whose geometry is already presentation-ready — the 3D
//! mesher can simply extrude edges without additional spline smoothing.
